    "## Designing and Creating a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be working with a file of Major League Baseball games from [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting to Know the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrosheet compiles detailed statistics on baseball games from the 1800s through to today. The main file we will be working from game_log.csv, has been produced by combining 127 separate CSV files from retrosheet, and has been pre-cleaned to remove some inconsistencies. The game log has hundreds of data points on each game which we will normalize into several separate tables using SQL, providing a robust database of game-level statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the main file, we have also included three 'helper' files, also sourced from Retrosheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "   + park_codes.csv\n",
    "   + person_codes.csv\n",
    "   + team_codes.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "These three helper files in some cases contain extra data, but will also make things easier as they will form the basis for three of our normalized tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important first step when working with any new data is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA gets us familiar with the data and gives us a level of background knowledge that will help us throughout our project. The methods we use when performing EDA will depend on what we plan to do with the data. In this case, we're wanting to create a normalized database, so our focus should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "   + Becoming familiar, at a high level, with the meaning of each column in each file.\n",
    "   + Thinking about the relationships between columns within each file.\n",
    "   + Thinking about the relationships between columns across different files.\n",
    "\n",
    "A game_log_fields.txt file is included from Retrosheet which explains the fields included in our main file, which will be useful to assist our EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started exploring the data by using pandas to read and explore the data."

    "## Importing Data into SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "We have got farmilar with all the files. To create a normalized database from the four files, we need to import all the data into SQLite. \n",
    "\n",
    "To insert data into a noramalized database, we'll need a single column that can be used as a primary key. The game log file does not have a single column that can be used as a primary key to uniquely identify each game. There are three ways that we could handle this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   + Make a compound primary key, such as a primary key of the date, h_name, and number_of_game columns.\n",
    "   + Insert an integer primary key, eg where the first row is 1, the second row is 2, etc.\n",
    "   + Insert a new column using a custom format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have not yet normalized our data, it's better not to start with a compound primary key - if we do this, we might end up needing to create a compound key in another table that includes this compound key, which would quickly become cumbersome to work with. An integer primary key is a good choice, but we should first explore whether Retrosheet already have a system for uniquely identifying each game. If they do, this is a better option. It means that if at some later stage we choose to incorporate more detailed game data into our database, the keys we use will be compatible with other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the Retrosheet site, we can find a [data dictionary](https://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm) for their event files, which list every event within each game. This includes the following description:\n",
    "\n",
    "id: Each game begins with a twelve character ID record which identifies the date, home team, and number of the game. For example, ATL198304080 should be read as follows. The first three characters identify the home team (the Braves). The next four are the year (1983). The next two are the month (April) using the standard numeric notation, 04, followed by the day (08). The last digit indicates if this is a single game (0), first game (1) or second game (2) if more than one game is played during a day, usually a double header The id record starts the description of a game thus ending the description of the preceding game in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This essentially makes a custom key using the three columns we identified in our composite key example earlier. After we import the data, we'll construct this column to use as a primary key in our final database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next task is to import the data into SQLite. Because we've already read the data into dataframes, we'll use pandas library to import the data."
